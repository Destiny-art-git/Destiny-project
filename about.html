            Hello. Welcome to my about me page. Here you get to learn a little more about me.
            I was born and raised in the west side Salt Lake City, Utah. The west side of Salt
            Lake is associated with the ghettos. Growing up there gave me a
            a much different perspective. I saw it as an area full of
            culture, diversity and hard working families. I loved it.
