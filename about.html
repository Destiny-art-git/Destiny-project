            Hello. Welcome to my about me page. Here you get to learn a little more about me.
            I was born and raised in the west side Salt Lake City, Utah. The west side of Salt
            Lake is associated with the ghettos. Growing up there gave me a
            a much different perspective. I saw it as an area full of
            culture, diversity and hard working families. I loved it.

            I became a dental assistant for Dr. Stephen J. Davis when I was 17 years old and
            a senior in high school. I loved working with people and meeting such a wide
            range of personalities. The office became like a second home to me.
            It was my area to welcome patients who were sometimes nervous into a space
            of understanding and support. I worked for Dr. Davis for 11 years. I began schooling to become a dental
            hygenist and
            was 3 classes away from applying when my life grew even better. I found
            out I was pregnant with my daughter. I decided to be a stay at home mom after having
            her. I unfortunatley experienced post-partum depression which made figuring out my
            new life hard. Thats a story for another day. I have loved being a mom. She is the light
            of my life. She is so funny and care-free. I read a quote once that said "While
            we teach our kids, they truely teach us what life is about." How true is that!
